<h1>Contact - Not just another <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact Us</span> page!</h1>
<p>The first question that always comes to mind when someone see's a module like this is - <span style="font-style: italic;">Why?</span><br><br>
For starters, there are many other versions of a Contact Us module out there - but guess what, none of them
did what I needed, or the client I wrote this for.  As with any module <a href="http://xoops.ibdeeming.com" target="_blank">XOOPS</a>@<a href="http://www.ibdeeming.com" target="_blank">IBDeeming!</a>
puts out, I always find more options and configs that can be added.   I think I have stretched this one out, and 
really expect it will meet most any need out there!  Whew - now check this out...</p>
<h2>Contact v1.6 - Updates to email deep check and From addressee</h2>
<p>For the most part, this module is the same as v1.5.  The upgrade path is very simple.  The changes made are
<ul><li>New deep check validation on submitted return email addresses<ul><li>The problem was with the socket command.  Added routine to verify
MX records first.  This sped up the overall check routine.</li></ul></li><li>Added AAINC (XOOPS@IBDeeming! User) suggestion for Fomr email who</li></ul>
</p>
<p>Upgrading from V1.5 - V1.6 is very easy!  Just copy the files, log-in as admin, go to Modules control, and Update the Contact-Us module.  
If you are successful, you should see version 1.6.</p>
<h2>Contact V1.5 - Based on the original by Skalpa - but nothing like it anymore!</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact v1.5</span> has many new features, so many that it doesn't really look like the original.  First off, there are
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span> configs that can be applied to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact</span> module.
<ul>
  <li>Settings
    <ul>
	  <li>Send Confirmation Switch - Basically allows the user to copy themselves on correspondence to you of your department (more on that).</li>
	  <li>Collect ICQ - on or off</li>
	  <li>Collect URL - on or off</li>
	  <li>Collect Company - on or off</li>
	  <li>Collect Location - on or off</li>
	  <li>Collect Address - on or off</li>
	  <li>Add Security Check - Security graphic - know why?  It's really easy to SPAM your site with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact</span> emails, this will help deter
	    <ul>
		  <li>Sitekey definition - allows you to seed granularity</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>	
	  <li>Redirect Timeout - Allows you to set how long the redirect page is shown to the user</li>  
	  <li>Validate Domain - Allows you to actually "deep-scan" the domain and tld for validity</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>General
    <ul>
	  <li>Introduction - You can turn it on, set the heading, and the text displayed.  This is great for businesses that want to show off their SNAIL address and phone numbers</li>
	  <li>Contact heading - What is your form called?</li>
	  <li>Thank You message - what your user sees</li>
	  <li>Department Definition - this is cool!  Basically you can set up departments and have them assigned to different email addresses than just the site admin.</li>
	  <li>More Info - Have you ever seen those commercial contact pages where you can select from various topics to get more info?  Now you can do it too!</li>
	</ul>
  </li>  
</ul>
</p>
<h2>So, How do I install <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact?</span></h2>
<p>It's really simple!
  <ol>
    <li>Deactivate your current Contact module</li>
